# Hi, I'm Des 👋

DevOps and AI Cloud Engineer based in Jacksonville, FL. I come from an IT consulting and accounting background, and I made a deliberate pivot into engineering. Now I build, automate, and deploy real cloud infrastructure.

I document everything. The wins, the errors, the 2 am debugging sessions. If you're learning too, you'll find something useful here.
